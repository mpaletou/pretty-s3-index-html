Pretty S3 index.html
====================

This project is a fork of Nolan Lawson's original S3 index.html, updated and reworked to support modern directory navigation. Folders are now displayed in a tree structure and can be expanded or collapsed dynamically, allowing you to browse nested directories without reloading the page. The UI is Bootstrap-styled and user-friendly, and works with any public S3 or S3-compatible bucket.

Usage
-------

Just place the `index.html` file in the root of your bucket. It will automatically list the contents of your bucket in a modern, responsive table. Folder navigation and file details are supported out of the box.

You can see a live example [here][1].

For comparison, the [original index.html created by Amazon][2] looks [like this][3].
